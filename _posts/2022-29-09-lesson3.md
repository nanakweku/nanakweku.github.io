# Welcome to lesson 3

In this lesson 1 we took a dive into Jekyll
Jekyll basically allows you to quickly develop websites without needing to be a wizard in HTML and CSS.
jekyll helps you to build websites without reinventing the wheel or creating it from scratch
* Jekyll is very amazing at making a website that you dopnt really have to constantly mentain . Meaning the framework is specifically targeted at static websites
* With bootstrap or jekyll you dont have to worry about learning everything about HTML, CSS, Javascript and etc but rather create professional sites with a rather good fremework 

* In lesson 3, i was able to grab a vivid understanding of jekyll and frameworks. The videos provided an in depth understanding to the benefits of using Frameworks
* The main advantage of jekyll is in the simplicity that can be achieved in both the work with the website generator and the created projects.
