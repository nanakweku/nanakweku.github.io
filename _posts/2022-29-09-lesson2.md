# Welcome to lesson 2

In this lesson 2 we dove into HTML and CSS while advancing in the use of Github. 
HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display.
i was able to learn about HTML and enhance my CSS knowledge 

``` html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <title>Hello, World!</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <section>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </section>

    </body>
    </html>
